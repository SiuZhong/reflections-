What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	You great a .git file which can not be seen by users.

	You need one to use git

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	staging area shows what is about to be committed, while repository shows what is already committed and working directory shows what is not.

	This allows us to commit different things by themselves or together. 


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	double check commit contatins everything you want to commit

	make sure the commit isnt too logn
