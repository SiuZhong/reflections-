How did veiwing a diff between two versions help you see the bug that was introduced?

	It showed me what was added and removed form the old and new versions.

	This allowed me to easily compare what was changed

	the + showed the new version that i comapred with the - in the old version.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

	When collborating you could see who has made chagnes.

	you could back to to versions which worked 


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

	Pros
		- more flexible
		- can tailor commits to be logical
		- can make sure each commit can compile and run

	Cons
		- may forget to commit
		- commit sizes will vary


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	because programs usually need multiple files to run and the files are interconnected 

	documents on google docs are usually not related 


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

	if you break something you can just revert/checkout to the old version

	you can also view different versions to see what caused the break. 


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

	solving problems in my previous code

	being more risky in my changes.
